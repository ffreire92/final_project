## Pandemic overview in Spain

In this article, we analyse the covid-19 pandemic evolution in Spain.

The data was extracted from https://datamarket.es/, containing the following information:

+ Date

+ Autonomous region

+ Province

+ Sex

+ Age interval

+ Number of infections

+ Number of hospitalisations

+ Number of Intensive Care Units

+ Number of death


This allows to study not only the most affected geographical areas and ages, but also how the pandemic is evolving over time.

Furthermore, a prediction model was trained in order to predict the number of infections, hospitalisations, Intensive Care Units and deaths for the following seven days.


Finally, a Dashboard was created in order to monitor the pandemic evolution in Spain alongside with its predictions, and also measure the impact over geographical areas and groups ages.
