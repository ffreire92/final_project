In this article, we analyse the covid-19 pandemic evolution in Spain.

The data was extracted from https://datamarket.es/, containing the following information:

+ Date

+ Autonomous region

+ Province

+ Sex

+ Age interval

+ Number of infections

+ Number of hospitalisations

+ Number of Intensive Care Units

+ Number of death


This allows to study not only the most affected geographical areas and ages, but also how the pandemic is evolving over time.

Furthermore, a prediction model was trained in order to predict the number of infections, hospitalisations, Intensive Care Units and deaths for the following seven days.

Finally, a Dashboard was created in order to monitor the pandemic evolution in Spain alongside with its predictions, and also measure the impact over geographical areas and groups ages. 


One may conclude that the number of Infections, Hospitalisations, Intensive Care Units and Deaths are declining on average and in line with the predictions, except for the Hospitalisations and Deaths.


The most affected areas were Comunidad de Madrid, Catalunya and Comunidad Valenciana. In Catalunya, we observe a significant difference between the Intensive Care Units and number of deaths, indicating that the colapse of the public health system had a higher impact in this region.

The elders are the most affected group ages, either in Hospitalisations and Deaths. Unfortunately, one can confirm that the Intensive Care Units is way below than the number of Deaths, explained by the fact that the public health system collapsed and there was no room for these group ages.
